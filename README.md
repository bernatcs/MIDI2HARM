# MIDI2HARM
Harmony chords in a new MIDI layer from MIDI or audio built in MaxMSP as a M4L device.

## Compilation
The project is configured using MaxMSP - M4L.

## Development
The main development steps are:

- Create an M4L device that can play fixed chords on another instrument with the SoftStep MIDI pads âœ…
- The chords should be played in a middle register _[developing]_
- The chords should be play in a harmonic way with coherent voicings every time
- Recognize and analyse the harmonic lenguage that is being used
- Play chords trigered by a pedal that can work in the harmonic lenguage
- Create a easy and minimal design to the M4L
- Create a standalone app
- Maintaining the application and listening to user requests :)
